# Code Documentation

Write documentation that helps future developers (including yourself) understand and use code effectively.

## Principles

**Philosophy**
- **Document why, not what** - Code shows what happens; docs explain why it exists and when to use it
- **Close to code** - Keep docs near the code they describe; external docs go stale faster
- **Audience-aware** - Docstrings for developers using the code; READMEs for those evaluating or setting up
- **Update with code** - Documentation changes are part of the code change, not a follow-up task

**What to Document**
- **All public APIs** - Every public function, class, and method gets a docstring
- **Complex logic** - Non-obvious algorithms, business rules, and workarounds
- **Decisions and tradeoffs** - Why this approach over alternatives
- **Skip the obvious** - Don't document `i += 1` or self-evident code

**Style**
- **Google style docstrings** - Consistent with python-development skill
- **Imperative mood** - "Return the user" not "Returns the user"
- **Examples over explanation** - Show usage when behavior isn't obvious
- **Keep it current** - Wrong documentation is worse than no documentation

## Python Docstrings (Google Style)

### Functions

```python
def fetch_user(user_id: int, include_deleted: bool = False) -> User | None:
    """Fetch a user by ID from the database.

    Retrieves the user record, optionally including soft-deleted users.
    Returns None if no matching user exists.

    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier of the user.
        include_deleted: If True, return soft-deleted users. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        The User object if found, None otherwise.

    Raises:
        DatabaseError: If the database connection fails.

    Example:
        >>> user = fetch_user(123)
        >>> user.email
        'user@example.com'
    """
```

### Classes

```python
class RateLimiter:
    """Token bucket rate limiter for API endpoints.

    Implements a token bucket algorithm that allows bursting while enforcing
    an average rate limit. Tokens regenerate at a fixed rate up to a maximum.

    Attributes:
        rate: Tokens added per second.
        capacity: Maximum tokens in the bucket.

    Example:
        >>> limiter = RateLimiter(rate=10, capacity=100)
        >>> if limiter.acquire():
        ...     process_request()
    """

    def __init__(self, rate: float, capacity: int) -> None:
        """Initialize the rate limiter.

        Args:
            rate: Tokens to add per second.
            capacity: Maximum bucket size.
        """
```

### Modules

```python
"""User authentication and session management.

This module provides authentication utilities including password hashing,
token generation, and session validation. It integrates with the User model
and requires Redis for session storage.

Typical usage:
    from auth import authenticate, create_session

    user = authenticate(email, password)
    if user:
        session = create_session(user)
"""
```

### Short Docstrings

```python
def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """Check if email matches a valid email pattern."""


def get_current_timestamp() -> datetime:
    """Return the current UTC timestamp."""
```

## Inline Comments

### When to Comment

```python
# GOOD: Explain why, not what
# Use binary search here because the list is always sorted and can have 100k+ items
index = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_items, target)

# GOOD: Clarify non-obvious behavior
# Stripe requires amount in cents, not dollars
amount_cents = int(dollars * 100)

# GOOD: Document workarounds
# HACK: Sleep to avoid race condition in legacy API (see issue #1234)
time.sleep(0.1)

# BAD: Restating the code
# Increment counter by 1
counter += 1

# BAD: Obvious from context
# Check if user is None
if user is None:
```

### TODO/FIXME Format

```python
# TODO(username): Add retry logic for transient failures
# FIXME: This breaks when timezone is not UTC (issue #567)
# HACK: Temporary workaround until upstream fixes bug
# NOTE: This must run before database migrations
```

### README Principles

- **Lead with value** - What problem does this solve?
- **Quick start first** - Get users running in <2 minutes
- **Copy-pasteable commands** - Use code blocks for all commands
- **Link, don't duplicate** - Reference detailed docs instead of repeating

## API Documentation

### Endpoint Documentation

```python
@app.post("/users", response_model=UserResponse, status_code=201)
async def create_user(
    user: UserCreate,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session),
) -> User:
    """Create a new user account.

    Creates a user with the provided email and name. Sends a welcome
    email asynchronously. Returns 409 if email already exists.

    Args:
        user: User creation payload with email and name.

    Returns:
        The created user with generated ID and timestamps.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 409 if email already registered.
    """
```

### OpenAPI Enhancements

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class UserCreate(BaseModel):
    """Payload for creating a new user."""

    email: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="User's email address",
        example="user@example.com",
    )
    name: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="User's display name",
        example="Jane Smith",
        min_length=1,
        max_length=100,
    )

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    """User data returned from API."""

    id: int = Field(..., description="Unique user identifier")
    email: str = Field(..., description="User's email address")
    name: str = Field(..., description="User's display name")
    created_at: datetime = Field(..., description="Account creation timestamp")
```

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to document significant technical decisions.

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a primary database for user data, transactions, and application state.
Options considered: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.

## Decision

Use PostgreSQL because:
- Strong ACID compliance for financial transactions
- JSONB support for flexible metadata without separate document store
- Excellent tooling and team familiarity

## Consequences

- Need PostgreSQL expertise for operations
- Some queries may need optimization vs document stores
- Gain transactional integrity and relational modeling
```

### ADR File Organization
