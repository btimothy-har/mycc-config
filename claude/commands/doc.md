#$ARGUMENTS

Always use the `documentation-generator` agent as a starting point.

Implementing the documentation:
1) Always prefer inline documentation where available (e.g. docstrings, table schemas, etc)
2) Excessive documentation requirements may demand usage of supplementary documentation like a README.md document or similar

Where using supplementary documentation, place it in the same directory as the code segments you are documenting.
